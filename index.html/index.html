	  				<h4>Git WorkFlow</h4>
	  			</header>
	  			<p>Git workflow allows a group of collaborators to work on the same project, editing the master in their own specific branches. If there is a certain change they want to insert to the master, from their branch, they would have to make a pull request that gives the administrator a notification to merge Collab 1's work to the master. However, if there is a conflict (indicates the branch is working off of an older version of the master), then the user has to resolve the issue by updating their code AND then input their new changes to the request.</p>
